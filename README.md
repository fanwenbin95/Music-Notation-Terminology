# Music-Notation-Terminology
A simple markdown about music notation terms in English and Chinese. Please contribute to this repo freely. 

本仓库用于记录**音乐记谱法**中的术语，用于建立英译汉的术语库。

I don't want to build up a whole dictionary due to the copyrights of dictionaries. Also it will be dull and exhausted if I build it solely. You could contact me if you are interested in this big plan.

## Chapters
A great work begins from a great planning. I set up some chapters. All the chapters are in one file only. 
## Format
Each record is written in Markdown table. Do not care about the order of records. 

The format of table is four columns like this,
```
| <foreign word> | <Chinese recommended> | <Chinese alternative> | <comments> |
```
For instance, these two entries can be written as
```
| ensemble | 系综 | | 读作昂桑包 |
| Ewald summation | 埃瓦尔德求和 | 埃瓦德求和 | | 
```
which would be shown as below. 
| | | | |
| --- | ---| --- | --- |
| ensemble | 系综 | | 读作昂桑包 |
| Ewald summation | 埃瓦尔德求和 | 埃瓦德求和 | | 

## After Markdown

IMHO the markdown is free to write but it is hardly to be handled as database. I planned to program several Python routines to convert all the machine-friendly format. Surely these entries will be sorted alphabetically.
